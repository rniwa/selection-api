        This document is a preliminary draft of a specification for the Selection API and selection related functionality.
        It replaces a couple of old sections of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML specification</a>,
        the selection part of the old <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range-20001113/ranges.html">DOM Range specification</a>.

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>IE9 and Firefox 6.0a2 allow arbitrary ranges in the selection, which follows what this spec originally said.
        However, this leads to unpleasant corner cases that authors, implementers, and spec writers all have to deal with,
        and they don't make any real sense.  Chrome 14 dev and Opera 11.11 aggressively normalize selections,
        like not letting them lie inside empty elements and things like that, but this is also viewed as a bad idea,
        because it takes flexibility away from authors.</p>

      <p>So I changed the spec to a made-up compromise that allows some simplification but doesn't constrain authors much.
        See <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-June/032072.html">discussion</a>.
        Basically it would throw exceptions in some places to try to stop the selection from containing a range that had
        a boundary point other than an Element or Text node, or a boundary point that didn't descend from a Document.</p>

      <p>But this meant getRangeAt() had to start returning a copy, not a reference.
        Also, it would be prone to things failing weirdly in corner cases. Perhaps most significantly, all sorts of problems
        might arise when DOM mutations transpire, like if a boundary point's node is removed from its parent and
        the mutation rules would place the new boundary point inside a non-Text/Element node.
        And finally, the previously-specified behavior had the advantage of matching two major implementations,
        while the new behavior matched no one.  So I changed it back.</p>

      <div class=note>
      <p>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15470">bug 15470</a>. IE9, Firefox 12.0a1, Chrome 17 dev,
        and Opera Next 12.00 alpha all make the range initially null.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>

      <p>Every <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#document">document</a></dfn> ([[DOM4]]) with
        a <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#browsing-context">browsing context</a></dfn> ([[HTML5]])
        has a unique <a href="#idl-def-Selection"><code>Selection</code></a> object associated with it.
        <a>Selection</a> objects are known as <dfn>selection</dfn>s.</p>

      <p class=note>This is a requirement of the HTML spec.
        IE9 and Opera Next 12.00 alpha seem to follow it, while Firefox 12.0a1 and Chrome 17 dev seem not to.
        See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=717339">Mozilla bug</a>,
        <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76114">WebKit bug</a>.</p>

      <p>This one <a>selection</a> must be shared by all the content of the <a>document</a>
        (though not by nested <a>document</a>s), including any editing hosts in the document.
        <dfn>Editing hosts</dfn> (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#editing-host">defined</a> in [[HTML5]]) that are not
        inside a <a>document</a> cannot have a <a>selection</a></p>

      <p class=issue>We need to define what it means to say editing hosts can't have selection.</p>

      <p>Each <a>selection</a> can be associated with a single <dfn>range</dfn> (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#range">defined</a> in [[DOM4]]).
        When there is no <a>range</a> associated with the <a>selection</a>, the </a>selection</a> is <dfn>empty</dfn>.
        The selection must be initially <a>empty</a>.</p>

      <p class=note>A <a>document</a>'s <a>selection</a> is a singleton object associated with that <a>document</a>,
        so it gets replaced with a new object when <code>Document.open()</code> is called.
        See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15470">bug 15470</a>.
        IE9 and Opera Next 12.00 alpha allow the user to reset the range to null after the fact by clicking somewhere;
        Firefox 12.0a1 and Chrome 17 dev do not.
        We follow Gecko/WebKit, because it lessens the chance of getRangeAt(0) throwing.</p>

      <p>Once a <a>selection</a> is associated with a given <a>range</a>,
        it must continue to be associated with that same <a>range</a> until this specification requires otherwise.</p>

      <p class=note>For instance, if the DOM changes in a way that changes the range's boundary points,
        or a script modifies the boundary points of the range, the same range object must continue to be associated with the selection.
        However, if the user changes the selection or a script calls <code>addRange()</code>,
        the selection must be associated with a new range object, as required elsewhere in this specification.</p>

      <p class=issue>This paragraph is vague.
        It needs to be replaced by detailed conformance requirements saying exactly what to do for particular keystrokes,
        like we have for backspace/delete/etc.</p>

      <p>If the <a>selection</a>'s <a>range</a> is not null and is
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-range-collapsed"><dfn id="range-collapsed">collapsed</dfn></a> ([[DOM4]]),
        then the caret position must be at that <a>range</a>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-range-bp"><dfn>boundary point</dfn></a>.
        <a></a><dfn></dfn>
        When the <a>selection</a> is not empty, this specification does not define the caret position;
        user agents should follow platform conventions in deciding whether the caret is at the start of the <a>selection</a>,
        the end of the <a>selection</a>, or somewhere else.

      <p class=note>This short-changes Mac users. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13909">bug 13909</a>.

      <p>Each <a>selection</a> has a <dfn>direction</dfn>, <dfn>forwards</dfn>, <dfn>backwards</dfn>, or <dfn>directionless</dfn>.
        If the user creates a <a>selection</a> by indicating first one <a>boundary point</a> of the <a>range</a>
        and then the other (such as by clicking on one point and dragging to another),
        and the first indicated <a>boundary point</a> is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-range-bp-after"><dfn>after</dfn></a> ([[DOM4]]) the second,
        then the corresponding <a>selection</a> must initially be <a>backwards</a>.
        If the first indicated <a>boundary point</a> is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-range-bp-before"><dfn>before</dfn></a> ([[DOM4]]) the second,
        then the corresponding <a>selection</a> must initially be <a>forwards</a>.
        Otherwise, it must be <a>directionless</a>.</p>

      <p class=issue>Should <code>addRange()</code> and <code>removeAllRanges()</code> reset direction?</p>

      <p><a>Selection</a>s also have an <dfn>anchor</dfn> and a <dfn>focus</dfn>.
        If the <a>selection</a>'s <a>range</a> is null, its <a>anchor</a> and <a>focus</a> are both null.
        If the <a>selection</a>'s <a>range</a> is not null and its <a>direction</a> is <a>forwards</a>, its <a>anchor</a> is the <a>range</a>'s
        <a>start</a>, and its <a>focus</a> is the <a>end</a>.
        Otherwise, its <a>focus</a> is the <a>start</a> and its <a>anchor</a> is the <a>end</a>.</p>

        <dt>readonly attribute Node? anchorNode</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The attribute must return the <a>anchor</a> <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-node">node</a></dfn> ([[DOM4]])
          of the <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#context-object">context object</a></dfn> ([[DOM4]]),

          <p>The attribute must return the <a>focus</a> <a>node</a> of the <a>context object</a>,

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute unsigned long focusOffset</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The attribute must return the <a>focus</a> <a>offset</a> of the <a>context object</a>,
          or <code>0</code> if the <a>focus</a> is null.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute boolean isCollapsed</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The attribute must return true if and only if the <span>anchor</span> and <span>focus</span> are the same (including if both are null).
          Otherwise it must return false.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute unsigned long rangeCount</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The attribute must return <code>0</code> if the <a>context object</a>'s <a>range</a> is <a>empty</a>,
          and must return <code>1</code> otherwise.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Range getRangeAt(unsigned long index)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The method must throw an <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#indexsizeerror"><code>IndexSizeError</code></a></dfn> ([[DOM4]]) exception
          if <var>index</var> is not <code>0</code>, or if the <a>context object</a> is <a>empty</a>.
          Otherwise, it must return a reference to (not a copy of) the <a>context object</a>'s <a>range</a>.</p>

          <p class=note>Thus subsequent calls of this method returns the same <a>range</a> object
            if nothing has removed the <a>context object</a>'s range in the meantime.
            In particular, <code>getSelection().getRangeAt(0) === getSelection().getRangeAt(0)</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>
            if the <a>selection</a> is not <a>empty</a>.</p>

          <p class=note>IE9 and Firefox 4.0 return the same object every time, as the spec says.
            Chrome 12 dev and Opera 11.10 return a different object every time.</p>
        </dd>
  
        <dt>void addRange(Range range)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The method must set the <a>context object</a>'s range to <var>range</var> by a strong reference (not by making a copy).</p>
  
          <p class=note>Since <a>range</a> is added by reference, subsequent calls to <code>getRangeAt(0)</code> returns the same object,
            and any changes that a script makes to <a>range</a> after it is added must be reflected in the <a>selection</a>,
            until something else removes or replaces the <a>context object</a>'s <a>range</a>.
            In particular, the <a>selection</a> will contain <var>b</var> as opposed to <var>a</var> after running the following code:
            <code>var r = document.createRange(); r.selectNode(a); getSelection().addRange(r); r.selectNode(b);</code></p>

          <div class=note>
          <p>IE9 and Firefox 4.0 store a reference, as described here.
            Chrome 12 dev and Opera 11.10 appear to store a copy, so changes don't affect the selection.</p>

          <p>Chrome 15 dev seems to ignore addRange() if there's already a range.
            IE9 replaces the existing range.
            Firefox 9.0a2, of course, just gives you a multi-range selection.
            IE is likely to behave closest to Firefox, and is also more useful than silent failure, so the spec goes with that.</p>

          <p class=note>Reverse-engineered circa January 2011.
            IE doesn't support it, so I'm relying on Firefox (implemented extend() sometime before 2000) and WebKit (implemented extend() in 2007).
            I'm mostly ignoring Opera, because gsnedders tells me its implementation isn't compatible.

            Firefox 12.0a1 seems to mutate the existing range.
            IE9 doesn't support extend(), and it's impossible to tell whether Chrome 17 dev or Opera Next 12.00 alpha mutate or replace,
            because getRangeAt() returns a copy anyway.
            Nevertheless, I go against Gecko here, to be consistent with collapse().</p>

          <p>The method must follow these steps:</p>
          <ol>

          <div class=note>
          <p>Based mostly on Firefox 9.0a2.  It has a bug that I didn't reproduce, namely
          that if you pass a Document as the argument, the end offset becomes 1 instead
          of the number of children it has.  It also throws a RangeException instead of
          DOMException, because its implementation predated their merging.

          <p>IE9 behaves similarly but with glitches.  It throws "Unspecified error." if
          the node is detached or display:none, and apparently in some random other cases
          too.  It throws "Invalid argument." for detached comments (only!).  Finally, if
          you pass it a comment, it seems to select the whole comment, unlike with text
          nodes.

          <p>Chrome 16 dev behaves as you'd expect given its Selection implementation.
          It refuses to select anything that's not visible, so it's almost always wrong.
          Opera 11.50 just does nothing in all my tests, as usual.

          <p>The new range replaces any existing one, doesn't mutate it.
          This matches IE9 and Firefox 12.0a1.  (Chrome 17 dev and Opera Next 12.00
          alpha can't be tested, because getRangeAt() returns a copy anyway.)

          Otherwise the method must do nothing.</p>
  
          <p class=note>This is the one method that actually mutates the range instead of replacing it.
            This matches IE9 and Firefox 12.0a1. (Chrome 17 dev and Opera Next 12.00 alpha can't be tested,

          <p class=issue>Should we replace the range rather than mutating it here?
            This is currently the only Selection method that actually mutates an existing range in place.</p>

      <p class=note>See also <a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/content/base/public/nsISelection.idl">nsISelection.idl</a> from Gecko.
        This spec doesn't have everything from there yet, in particular selectionLanguageChange() and containsNode() are missing.
        They are missing because I couldn't work out how to define them in terms of Ranges.</p>

      <section class=note>
        <p>Originally, the Selection interface was a Netscape feature.
          The original implementation was carried on into Gecko (Firefox), and the feature was later implemented independently by other browser engines.
          The Netscape implementation always allowed multiple ranges in a single selection, for instance so the user could select a column of a table
          However, multi-range selections proved to be an unpleasant corner case
          that web developers didn't know about and even Gecko developers rarely handled correctly.
          Other browser engines never implemented the feature, and clamped selections to a single range in various incompatible fashions.</p>

        <p>This specification follows non-Gecko engines in restricting selections to at most one range,
          but the API was still originally designed for selections with arbitrary numbers of ranges.
          This explains oddities like the coexistence of <code>removeRange()</code> and <code>removeAllRanges()</code>,
          and a <code>getRangeAt()</code> method that takes an integer argument that must always be zero.</p>
      </section>

      <p>All of the members of the <code>Selection</code> interface are defined
        in terms of operations on the <code><a>range</a></code> object (if any) represented by the object.
        These operations can raise exceptions, as defined for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#range"><code>Range</code></a> ([[DOM4]]) interface;
        this can therefore result in the members of the <a href="#idl-def-Selection"><code>Selection</code></a> interface raising exceptions as well,
        in addition to any explicitly called out below.</p>

      <p class=issue>We need to ensure we can only add ranges that are in the document associated with the selection.</p>

      <h2>Extensions to Other Interfaces</h2>

      <p>This specification extends several interfaces to provide entry points to the
      interfaces defined in this specification.</p>

      <h3>Extensions to <code>Document</code> interface</h3>
      <dl title="partial interface Document" class="idl">
        <dt>Selection? getSelection()</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The method must return the <a>selection</a> associated with <a>context object</a>
            if the <a>context object</a> has an associated <a>browsing context</a>,
            and it must return <code>null</code> otherwise.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p class=note>
        If we create a Document object with no browsing context
        (say via <code>document.implementation.createHTMLDocument("")</cpde> and call </code>getSelection()</code> on it),
        IE9 seems to return a different Selection object.
        Firefox 12.0a1 and Opera Next 12.00 alpha return the same object as for the current window.
        Chrome 17 dev returns null.
        See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JanMar/0159.html">discussion</a>.
        There's no meaningful selection associated with such a document, so we follow WebKit and require returning <code>null</code>.</p>

      <h3>Extensions to <code>Window</code> interface</h3>
      <dl title="partial interface Window" class="idl">
        <dt>Selection? getSelection()</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The method must invoke and return the result of <a><code>getSelection()</code></a> on the <a>context object</a>'s
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#dom-document-0"><code>document</code></a> ([[HTML5]]) property.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
  
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>User Interactions</h2>

      <p>The user agent should allow the user to change the <a>selection</a> associated with the <dfn>active document</dfn>
        (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#active-document">defined</a> in [[HTML5]]).
        If the user makes any modification to a <a>selection</a>, the user agent must create a new <a>range</a> with suitable
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-range-start"><dfn id="range-start">start</dfn></a> and 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-range-end"><dfn id="range-end">end</dfn></a> of the <a>range</a> ([[DOM4]])
        and associate the <a>selection</a> with this new <a>range</a> (not modify the existing <a>range</a>).</p>

      <p>The user agent must not make a <a>selection</a> <a>empty</a> if it was not already <a>empty</a>
        in response to any user actions (e.g. clicking on a non-editable region).</p>

      <p class=note>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15470">bug 15470</a>.
        IE9 and Opera Next 12.00 alpha allow the user to reset the range to null after the fact by clicking somewhere;
        Firefox 12.0a1 and Chrome 17 dev do not.
        I follow Gecko/WebKit, because it lessens the chance of getRangeAt(0) throwing.</p>

      <p class=issue>Define <code>select</code> and <code>selectionchange</code> events.</p>
